(a)Description:

The purpose of this application is to scrape the UCSB course pages for courses with user-defined atrributes.

(b)User Stories:

As a Student, I can look up classes that fulfill a certain requirement so that I don't have to do it by hand (which is slow).

As a Student, I can look up classes in a certain department, so I can see what classes are in a given department.

(c)Assessment:
The software runs, although it is very slow, and the interface is confusing and unintuitive.  It will ask for an Area or Department, then it will display the classes that quilify (Though, for some inputs it does not work).

(c_2*)User Stories, for new features:
*there was a duplicate letter

As a User, I want to sort the results so that I can find the one im looking for easier.

As a User, I want to collapse categories, so I don't have to scroll through unneccesary information.

As a User, I want to see what quarters the courses might be available so that I can plan my schedule accordingly.

(d)README Assessment:

The current README has some technical/outdated info about the project, it also does not contain much information about the project itself, only the purpose and what past users have changed.  The README could use some more details on the program itself, such as the basic layout and high-level workflow of how it works.  Also some documentation on the usage would be nice.

(e)build.xml Assessment:

The targets need less vague descriptions, because at first glance, we don't know what the non-standard targets are doing.

(f)Issues:

There seems to be enough issues to get 1000 points, once we take into consideration the unlisted issues that JDogg said we could earn points from.  The current issues are broad enough where there shouldnt be much of a problem inplementing them. Although there seems to be some outdated issues (that don't really apply to this course)

(g)Additional Issues:

We discussed some issues with JDogg, but haven't made concrete enough plans to submit an issue.  We discussed:
   >translating the scraping code to use jsoup
   >adding a gui
   >sorting/filtering results
   >collapse/expand sections of results
   >"has to be shiny, crisp, sexy... has to induce epilepsy" -Simon Huynh 2016

(h)Code Assessment:

The code seems relatively unorganized at first glance.  It is kind of hard to understand the code without digging through it.  The javadoc comments are helpful though and contain some pretty useful information where the method names fail to convey what they are for.  It starts out heavily commented, but then the comments slowly wane away leaving just code.  To help another programmer, I would probably explain the class relationships, then explain how the actual scraping and formatting works, because that is the most complicated part of the code.

(i)Test Assessment:

There is only one test.  So not much.  It could use a lot of help in the testing department. We would test the different cases of user input, because as of right now, only one input is tested, when in actuality there is a lot of different possible inputs.
