*Recent Changes of LAST LAST GROUP (W15)*

- Improved Javadoc
- Added JUnit Tests
- Refactored files for Git
- Fixed missing class case
- Added User interaction to input an Area (eg "B", "C")

*Recent Changes of LAST GROUP (W16)*

- Added a basic GUI
- Converted the code to use Jsoup (which in turn beautified the code and made it simpler)

*Notes from W16*

- Any changes to the codebase from this point forward will probably not involve the existing code, because there isn't much left to do with it
- Code changes will likely be new features or expanding the scraper to do other things
